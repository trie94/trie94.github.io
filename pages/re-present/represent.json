However, there are not enough resources that enables people to review their performances. To unclog this practice-review iteration cycle, this tool provides Practice mode, which generates a classroom space where people can practice their presentation with attentive audience; Summary, that visualizes performance results for each session; Review mode, that allows people to review their performance with a timeline tool that helps people  navigate between different moments.
